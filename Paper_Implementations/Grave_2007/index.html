                        Due to increasing number of people in emerging markets are obtaining access to computing devices, 
                        many exclusively using mobile devices with touchscreens online handwriting recognition has recently been 
                        gaining importance. Many of these users have native languages and scripts that are not as easily typed as English, 
                        e.g. due to the size of the alphabet or the use of grapheme clusters which make it difficult to design an intuitive keyboard layout. 
                        And nowadays more and more large mobile devices with styluses are becoming available, such as the iPad Pro , Microsoft Surface devices , 
                        and Chromebooks with styluses.

                    <p>
                        To train the online handwriting recognition system IAM-on-DB has been used which has writing samples
                        from 221 writers. The dataset has 13,049 lines of text which has 86,272 word instances and 
                        forms a vocabulary of length 11,059.

                        The eBeam interface2 is used for recording the handwriting. It allows the user to 
                        write on a whiteboard with a normal pen in a special casing, which sends infrared signals to 
                        a triangular receiver mounted in one of the corners of the whiteboard. The acquisition interface 
                        outputs a sequence of (x,y)-coordinates representing the location of the tip of the pen together 
                        with a time stamp for each location. The frame rate of the recordings varies from 30 to 70 frames 
                        per second.

                    <p>
                            The model takes a matrix of size 1940x40 as input. The model has two layers of Bi-directional LSTM having the same no of cells in both 
                            forward and backward direction. Each layer of BLSTM has 64 cells. The output of second BLSTM layer 
                            has been feeded into a dense layer of size 64(63 characters and one CTC blank) having a softmax activation. To train the network CTC loss has been used.
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>
                            The network weights were initialized with a Gaussian distribution of mean 0 and std. deviation 0.1. The network was trained with online gradient descent with momentum, using a 
                            learning rate of 1e−4 and a momentum of 0.9.
